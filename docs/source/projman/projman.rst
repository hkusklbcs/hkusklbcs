All project information, including documents, subject information, behavioral and imaging data, data analysis and results, should be made accessible to all lab members.

Here, a project folder structure is defined. I will go through the details in subsequent sections.

The project folder will be named as p<year>_<name>, e.g. p21_resilience.
